# Bankruptcy-Prediction

This notebook provides a tutorial on how to train a bankruptcy prediction model using machine learning and Python programming language. Data was collected from Kaggle and then  trained a logistic regression model to predict bankruptcy in the future. This Notebook walks through importing the dataset, exploring correlation, splitting the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance with an accuracy score, applying smote for resampling and removing biasness, feature selection, to enhance our models outcome.
